I'll be speaking at [Atlanta Code Camp](http://atlantacodecamp.com) on August 24. The talk will be an extended version of a talk I originally gave at an [Atlanta Web Design Group](http://awdg.org) event earlier this summer. You can [read my summary of that event here](ssg-awdg.html).

On the 24th we'll dig into the material in a bit more detail and see examples to for how to accomplish common development tasks. If time permits we'll discuss how to use static site generators to build interfaces for web apps and how to extend the process with shell scripts and other techniques.
