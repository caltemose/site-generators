Howdy. I gave a five-minute presentation for the Atlanta Web Design Group the evening of Thursday, June 27th, 2013. The talk happened at [Hypepotamus](http://hypepotamus.com), the great startup space in midtown Atlanta (thanks to Kevin and Heath). The rough outline for this presentation was:

1. The history of the process for building HTML pages (in 1 minute)
2. The complexity of modern process
3. Modern tools for simplifying and automating our process
4. How to choose which tools are right for you

And I concluded with a quick demo of how easy it is to modify, build and publish content using a modern static site generator (Middleman in this case). Q&amp;A followed.


Here are my [slides](assets/pdf/site-generators-preso.pdf).
